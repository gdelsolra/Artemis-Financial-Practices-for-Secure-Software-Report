# Artemis Financial Client Summary and Software Security Report

1. Client Summary and Software Requirements:

Artemis Financial, a financial services firm, needed to enhance the security of their SSL server application. 
They requested assistance to address vulnerabilities and protect sensitive client data more effectively.

2. Addressing Security Vulnerabilities and Its Importance:

I addressed Artemis Financialâ€™s vulnerabilities by implementing SHA-256 for hashing. This cryptographic hash 
function ensures data integrity by making it nearly impossible to produce identical hashes from different inputs. 
Secure coding is crucial for protecting data, maintaining client trust, and ensuring overall operational stability.

3. Challenges and Helpful Aspects of Vulnerability Assessment:

Updating dependencies and ensuring compatibility with newer versions was challenging but crucial for maintaining 
functionality and security. This experience emphasized the importance of regular updates and proactive security measures.

4. Increasing Layers of Security and Future Assessment Techniques:

I enhanced security by using SHA-256 and setting up a self-signed certificate for development. In the future, 
I would use automated tools and regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities more efficiently.

5. Ensuring Functional and Secure Code:

To confirm the code was functional and secure after refactoring, I conducted thorough testing and utilized security 
scanning tools to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

6. Useful Resources and Practices:

I employed OWASP Dependency-Check and followed secure coding practices. These tools and methods were crucial for
managing vulnerabilities and maintaining high security standards, and I plan to use them in future projects.

7. Showcasing Skills to Future Employers:

I would highlight my work with Artemis Financial, particularly the implementation of SHA-256 and the security 
enhancements made to their SSL server application. This project demonstrates my ability to handle real-world security 
challenges and apply effective solutions.
